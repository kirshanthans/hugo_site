abstract = "Multi-view video has gained widespread popularity in the recent years. 3DTV, surveillance, immersive teleconferencing and free view-point television are few notable applications of multi-view video. Excessive storage and transmission bandwidth requirements are the major challenges faced by the industry in facilitating multi-view video applications. This paper presents efficient tools for coding of multi-view video based on the state of the art single view video coding standard H.265/HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding). Our approach employs the LDI (Layered Depth Image) representation technique which is capable of compactly representing 3D scene content. We propose techniques and algorithms for LDI construction, view synthesis, efficient coding of LDI layers and associated auxiliary information. Subjective assessments indicate that our approach offers more than 50% reduction in bitrate compared to HEVC simulcast for the same subjective quality under practical operating bitrates."

I am Kirshanthan ("Krish") Sundararajah, a PhD candidate at the [Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu), [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu).

My research interests span the areas of compilers, programming languages, and high-performance computing.
I am particularly interested in solving performance challenges in irregular programs.
Recently, I have focused on reasoning about the correctness of composable scheduling transformations for general recursive programs. 

I am fortunate enough to advised by [Milind Kulkarni](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~milind).
I have earned my Bachelor's in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from [University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka](https://ent.uom.lk/).

I am Kirshanthan ("Krish") Sundararajah.
I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu), [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu).

My research interests span the areas of compilers, programming language, and high performance computing.
I am particularly interested in solving performance challenges in _irregular programs_.
I have recently focused on theorizing the correctness of _scheduling transformations_ for _general recursive programs_ as a means to bring _performance transparent abstractions_ to compilers. 

My adviser is [Milind Kulkarni](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~milind).
I have earned my bachelor's in electronic and telecommunication engineering from [University of Moratuwa](https://ent.uom.lk/).
